In 1987 he created the epic role-playing game, Final Fantasy, the name of which was inspired by the idea that if it did not sell he would go back to the university he had dropped out of several years earlier. Final Fantasy was a tremendous success. It is one of the best-selling video game franchises ever – the series had sold almost 100 million units as of 2010 – and is credited with popularizing many of the standard features of today’s role-playing games. Sakaguchi has also developed other successful games including Blue Dragon and Kingdom Hearts.'

The development took six years and almost bankrupted Tajiri’s company, Game Freak, but in 1996 the game was released to the world at large. Tajiri’s contribution to, and influence on, video game design has been recognized by IGN, Electronic Gaming Monthly and Edge magazine, and he is an undisputed giant of the industry. We trust the man who refused his salary while working on Pokémon is reaping the benefits of his hard work now.'
